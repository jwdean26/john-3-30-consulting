        <p>
          My name is <strong>John Dean</strong>, and I’ve been working in the technology field since 1986.
          For more than 25 years, my focus has been on <strong>researching, testing, recommending,
          implementing, and supporting Assistive Technology</strong> for individuals who face physical
          or cognitive challenges when using computers, tablets, and smartphones. This work has never
          been just a job for me — it’s a calling to help people stay connected, independent, and
          confident in a world that increasingly depends on technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of supporting individuals with a wide range of needs,
          including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>People who are blind or have low vision, using tools such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, Refreshable Braille displays, larger monitors, and customized display and accessibility settings.</li>
          <li>Individuals with mobility challenges who benefit from ergonomic keyboards, specialized mice, and speech recognition software.</li>
          <li>People with hearing differences who need help connecting hearing aids, cochlear implant processors, or Bluetooth accessories to their computers, tablets, smartphones, and televisions.</li>
          <li>Clients whose hearing aids are too old to connect directly to their devices and who need alternative headset solutions — including over‑ear cushioned headsets, earbud‑style devices, and bone conduction options.</li>
          <li>Individuals who are deaf and use sign language as their primary language, including support with interpreting solutions.</li>
          <li>People with hearing challenges who rely on captioning tools.</li>
          <li>Individuals who struggle to use their own voice and benefit from text‑to‑speech solutions.</li>
          <li>People with cognitive or neurosensory challenges who use text‑to‑speech and speech‑to‑text tools to communicate and work more effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          My approach has always been simple: <strong>meet people where they are, listen carefully,
          and recommend solutions that truly fit their needs</strong>. Technology should never be
          overwhelming — it should empower.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a personal note, I am a follower of Jesus Christ, a husband to my wonderful wife Brenda
          (married since 1985), a father to five grown and married children, and a grandfather to ten
          precious grandchildren. My faith and my family shape the way I serve others, reminding me
          daily that every person has value, purpose, and dignity. <strong>God is good all the time…
          and all the time, God is good.</strong>
